# Elk

Like [`reindeer`](https://github.com/facebookincubator/reindeer) but for Python 
+ Poetry dependencies.

### Install

```sh
pipx install poetry
pipx inject poetry .
```

### Quick start

Just follow along with the `example` folder. You'll probably want to copy the 
`elk.toml` and `platform.bzl` files.
